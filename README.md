Simple script made for my own use that shuts down the computer when the cpu usage is below a given percent.  
Should not be used if you need your computer to shut down as soon as this happens, as this scipt only checks the average usage every now and then.

By default the script checks if the average usage is below 1\% every ten seconds, but this can be changed using command line arguments
